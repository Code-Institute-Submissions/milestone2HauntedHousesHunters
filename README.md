The Second milestone project from the Full Stack Developer course with Code Institute.
The project is made based on the second module of the course that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It also uses Jquery, Google Maps API and EmailJS

## UX/UI 
This website is for terror and mystery fans. It compiles only 12 cases (for simplification) of reported 
haunted houses locations or places with an obscure history.      
The 12 examples taken, only cover Europe and America continents, again, for simplicity reasons.
I built my project based on two User Stories: a user searching for mystery stories details and a user who wishes to find where those events happened.

As a user looking for mystery stories I want to be able to get as much information as possible about each case well presented.      
As a user looking for finding the original places where those took place, I am familiar with the most famous cases already
and I want to see them all located on a map to find out if I have any close.

* Fonts Used        
The site only uses 2 font families. The idea was to use something according to 
the site topic, within vintage/horror lines. So the fonts chosen were:         
    1. monospace (as it looks like text written from old typewritter, it provides clarity to the 
    text and nice natural letter spacing easy to read).  Used for all texts    
    2. Jessen Cicero (external webfont as none of the usual ones matched the criteria) it gives a look 
    half way among vintage and horror. Used on text headings, navigation menu and buttons.

* Color palette used        
Only 4 plane colours have been used in the site for consistency. The only variation has been in opacity for some cases.     
#8d0134 red     
#c0b43c gold        
#fbf8f2 whitish     
#231f20 blackish

* Layouts       
The navigation menu has clear options at the top right that become a toggler icon when on small device screens.     
The houses.html page presents all the houses in a grid card format easy to navigate through them and to choose which one to read on one sight.     
Header and footer are consistent on all pages for ease.

* Wireframes mockups.       
As part of the design process I've used Balsamiq wireframes tool to create and visualize an 
initial structure of what the site was going to be. 
These files are included in the project itself (in an separate directory, the wireframes folder). 
There has been several changes during the project development from what the initial wireframes were:        
    1. Hero image from houses.html was deleted as it created worse UI since this page contains the cards info 
    of all houses, which should be the main focus of the user and not get distracted with the big hero image.       
    2. In the locations page, some text and image has been added later and the info window is only contained on the map.

## Features
These are the different parts of the project:

<dl>
<dt>Existing Features</dt>      

* The header image and title on the index page, tells the user exactly what the purpose of the website is.        
* The slider on the index page allows to quickly browse through the houses included in the site without going into detail, 
showing just the basic info house image, house name and location.       
* The users can inquiry about the houses shown on the page or about any other by contacting us using the formulary on contact.html
* The users can see all the houses displayed as a individual cards format with the image and information and they can
hide or show additional text on each with a readmore toggler function within the same page, without loading to an external link page,
allowing not to overload with text if not required and avoiding additional loading times.       
* On locations.html the users can find marked on a google map each house actual location with their exact geographical coords and they can click
on each marker to see displayed a small window info with a short info summary of the house.
  

<dt>Future development</dt>

Not applied due to time constraints.
* Styling the Google Map change default colors design so it better matches the vintage style or colors from the site.

* Adding more UI side effects with JQuery, like in the Slideshow that is currently made only with HTML and CSS with a very fixed paramethers creating some limitations
regarding positioning, styling with borders and resizing it in a more responsible and easier way.

* Adding some confirmation message after the formulary has been submitted on contact.html  

* Distance from user current position based on accessing user IP when selecting any location on the map.

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple device screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Using Chrome inspect.
All links are functional.
The form has validation working so no empty fields are left.
The map has all markers icons showing and all windows info displaying on click.

The following testing tools have been used:

Validator for html code     
[https://validator.w3.org/]

Validator for css code      
[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/]

Known problems      

The header image on index.html not fully responsive between 300 and 450px width.        
The html validator throws 2 errors unaddressed:     
* On index.html Attribute src not allowed on element a      
* The element button must not appear as a descendant of the  element a
