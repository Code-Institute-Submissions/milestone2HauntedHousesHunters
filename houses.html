                        <p class="house_para">Built in the 1860 decade. ‘Garden Reach’ was bought by Henry Swinhoe and wife Elisabeth Francis Higgins and they raised a family of five children. 
                        However, Elisabeth died and in 1870 Henry married again. His second wife was Imogen Hutchins, their relationship was marred by frequent quarrels, apparently over the upbringing of Swinhoe’s children as well as the possession of the former Mrs Swinhoe’s jewellery for which Henry had a secret hiding place fashioned under the drawing room floor.
                        Henry and Imogen separated in 1876 – Henry lived on at ‘Garden Reach’ for a few months before dying in July of the same year.</p> 
                        <p id="complete1"> 
                        Imogen died at Clifton in 1878 but was in fact buried at the Holy Trinity Church in Portland Street, Cheltenham, quite close to her former home.
                        In March 1882 the tenancy on the building was taken by Captain Frederick W. Despard and his family. 
                        The Despards lived here for ten years, leaving in 1893.
                        Rosina, one of Frederick's daughters, was the first witness of the appearance of the ghostly woman in black in the house two months after the Despards moved in.
                        Rosina kept written records of the appearances (half a dozen times during 2 years) of the apparition in the form of letters to a friend, Miss Catherine Campbell, 
                        and from this correspondence the 1892 report in the SPR’s Journal was eventually compiled. Rosina described the apparition for the first time. 
                        One evening after retiring to her room she was disturbed by the sound of someone at the bedroom door:
                        “ Going a few steps along the passage, I saw the figure of a tall lady, dressed in black, standing at the head of the stairs.  
                        After a few moments she descended the stairs, and I followed for a short distance, I had only a small piece of candle, and it suddenly burnt itself out; 
                        and being unable to see more, I went back to my room.”
                        Rosina describes the figure as being dressed in soft woollen material holding a handkerchief up to its face so partly obscuring the features, 
                        with either a long veil or a hood giving the figure the aspect of being that of a woman in mourning. 
                        Rosina was not the only one to see the figure, also her sister Freda and a housemaid also saw a figure which she took to be an intruder, 
                        also his brother Wilfred Despard was on the terrace outside the drawing room with a playmate when both boys saw a woman in obvious distress 
                        standing near to the drawing room window.
                        In 1884 an immediate neighbour General Annesley, corroborated the appearance of the figure, a lady whom he had seen crying in the orchard, 
                        which was visible from the road.
                        Up until 1886 the figure was solid and lifelike and was often mistaken for that of a living person.
                        The complete history of the house is known, and if we are to connect the figure with any of the previous occupants, she is the only person who in any way resembled 
                        the figure, the unfortunate Imogen Swinhoe who died three and a half years before the Despards moved in.

                        The Society for Psychical Research made a study of the haunting and came to the conclusion that as well as the experiences of the Despards in the 1880s, 
                        there was evidence for the reappearance of the woman in black in the neighbourhood up until relatively recent times.
                        Another incident took place in January 1970 when Cheltenham resident Mrs Jackson was having a driving lesson that took her past the gates of the house. 
                        She suddenly changed gear and began breaking sharply. She said she saw the figure of a tall woman wearing a long black dress had stepped off the pavement 
                        about twenty yards ahead into the path of the oncoming car.  
                        Another reported incident occurred in July 1985 when two witnesses, an Oxford University music graduate in his sixties and a friend, walking along Pitville Circus Road 
                        saw a tall woman dressed in black wearing a crinoline moving along the footpath of the house towards its junction with the main road.

                        <h3 class="house_head">2. Boleskine House. Foyers, UK</h3>
                        <p class="house_para">The parish of Boleskine was formed in the 13th Century. A Kirk and graveyard were built in the parish around this time. 
                        Minister Thomas Houston (1648–1705) was said to have had the task of hastily laying animated corpses back in their graves after a devious local wizard had 
                        raised the dead in Boleskine graveyard.
                        Boleskine House was built on the site of the kirk, which, according to legend, caught fire during congregation and killed everyone inside. 
                        The house was constructed in the 1760s by Colonel Archibald Fraser as a hunting lodge.
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete2">Occultist Aleister Crowley purchased Boleskine House from the Fraser family in 1899. Crowley believed the location was ideal to sequester 
                        himself to perform a series of operations.
                        Crowley became infamous for stories of conducting black magic and various other rituals while residing at the house. His lodge keeper, Hugh Gillies, suffered a number 
                        of personal tragedies, including the loss of two children. Crowley later claimed that his experiments with black magic had simply got out of hand.
                        Crowley left the property in 1913.
                        After the Second World War the house was owned by a Major Edward Grant. In 1965, Grant committed suicide in Crowley's bedroom with a shotgun.
                        Jimmy Page bought the house in 1970 as a collector of Crowley memorabilia who was fascinated by his ideas. After arranging for the house to be restored he spent 
                        little time at Boleskine, leaving things in the care of his friend Malcolm Dent.
                        When Dent moved into the house it was a wreck. There'd been at least one fire there.
                        Although Dent was a sceptic of the paranormal he soon started to experience strange occurrences. After a few weeks, he heard strange rumblings from the hallway 
                        which stopped when he investigated, but resumed after he closed the bedroom door. 
                        Dent explains "above Boleskine there's a place called Errogie which is supposed to be the geographical centre of the Highlands. Boleskine was then the nearest 
                        consecrated ground to Errogie and it's thought his soul, or part of it, ended here.”
                        Dent also experienced the "most terrifying night of my life" at Boleskine. He awoke one night to hear what sounded like a wild animal snorting and banging outside 
                        his bedroom door. It went on for some time and it was not until morning that Dent dared open the door, and there was nothing there. Another friend who stayed 
                        at Boleskine awoke one night claiming she had been attacked by "some kind of devil".
                        Other occurrences, such as chairs switching places, doors slamming open and closed for no reason and carpets and rugs rolling up inexplicably.
                        Since 1992 there have been several other private owners with no reported mysterious occurrences.
                        Today the interior of the house was almost totally destroyed by 2 fires happening in 2015 and 2019.
                        The ruins are now owned by the Boleskine House Foundation SCIO which plan to restore the house and gardens to their original form and then open the estate to the public.

                        <p class="house_para">One of the most beautiful buildings of Venezia’s Gran Canale, built (apparently) over the terrains of an old templary cemetery ground 
                        in gothic style restored in byzantines and renaissance elements. There are no ghost stories here, but the truth is that all inhabitants along the history of this 
                        building have died in strange circumstances. 
                        It is told that the first victim of the “house curse” was Marietta, the daughter of the initial builder, Darío Giovanni. Marieta died in 1515 stressed by 
                        debts and most absolute poverty after the death of her husband Vincenzo Barbaro, who stabbed himself. Even their son suffered a violent death, in fact he died 
                        in an ambush in Crete.
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete3">After this the house was owned by the Barbaro family, who lost their heirs murdered.
                        Next on the list is marquis Arbit Abdoll en 1806, who lost all of his fortune right after buying the house and died in misery.
                        The Englishman Radon Brown met his fate in 1838 when he became the new owner. In only four years he suffered a financial meltdown and his homosexual relationship 
                        was discovered: the scandal engulfed him so much that in 1842 he committed suicide in the palace together with his partner.
                        In the early 1900s the Palazzo hosted the French poet Henri de Regnier; but a serious illness struck the writer, so he couldn’t come back to Venice anymore.
                        For decades the building was empty, until 1964 when the tenor Mario del Monaco began the negotiations to buy the property. But the artist, on his way to Venice to 
                        finalize the details of the contract, was involved in a serious car accident that forced him to a long rehabilitation and made him decide to give up the purchase.
                        A few years later was bought by Count Filippo Giordano delle Lanze, who was killed inside the building in 1970 by a Croatian sailor named Raul Blasich, with whom he 
                        had a relationship. Blasich then fled to London, where he was murdered.
                        The palace was later bought by Kit Lambert, manager of the rock band The Who, who died a very short time later in London falling down stairs. Although he claims not 
                        to believe in the curse, Lambert had told some friends to sleep in the nearby Hotel Gritti gondoliers kiosk to “escape the ghosts that haunted him in the Palace”.
                        Fabrizio Ferrari, a venetian businessman, bought the house in the 80s and moved there with his sister Nicoletta. Ferrari lost all of his assets after taking possession 
                        of the building, while his sister died in a car accident without witnesses.
                        In the late 80s, the building was purchased by financier Raul Gardini. After the involvement in the scandal of Tangentopoli, committed suicide in 1993 in unclarified 
                        circumstances.
                        After that no one wanted to buy the house anymore, and the first brokerage company that had been mandated to sell surrendered and stranded down. In 2002, a week after 
                        renting it for a vacation in Venice, bass player John Entwistle died because of a heart attack.
                        In 2006 the property passed to an American company and it is currently being restored.

                        <p class="house_para">One of the buildings that attract the most historians, journalists and the curious. Psychophonies, mysterious images and dozens of stories 
                        talk about a child that runs around the corridors, stairs and salons looking for her mother.
                        The building was built in the XIX  century and inhabited by a business man Mateo de Murga and his son Jose.
                        Story tells that Jose fell in love with the daughter of a cigarette seller and wanted to marry her, the father opposed that.
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete4">Jose waited until his father died to marry her, and later on he discovered that the young woman he had fallen in love was actually his father's 
                        illegitimate daughter.
                        Jose went mad when he discovered this, he then rejected her, and they murdered Raimunda, the child they have had in common. Then it is said the corpse was hidden in 
                        a coffin behind a wall.
                        Although history has obscured the truth about Raimunda, we do know for sure that after the death of the Marquises, the palace passed from owner to owner without ever 
                        being inhabited for long, due to the frequent paranormal events that occurred there.
                        The years, decades and finally centuries passed, until in 1990 restoration works were taking place, an the strange events that continued to occur at the Palace of 
                        Linares became the focus of national attention.
                        Some workmen claimed to have heard strange voices. Specialists came to study the case and reported to have experienced strange happenings within the walls of the 
                        palace: gusts of wind, the sound of a baby crying, organ music, wailing, moans and lamentations of women.

                        <p class="house_para">The Catacombs of Paris are underground ossuaries, which hold the remains of more than six million people in a small part of a tunnel 
                        network built to consolidate Paris' ancient stone quarries.</p> 
                        <p id="complete5">Extending south from the Barrière d'Enfer ("Gate of Hell") former city gate, this ossuary was created as part of the effort to eliminate 
                        the city's overflowing cemeteries. Preparation work began not long after a 1774 series of gruesome Saint Innocents-cemetery-quarter basement wall collapses 
                        added a sense of urgency to the cemetery-eliminating measure, and from 1786, nightly processions of covered wagons transferred remains from most of Paris' 
                        cemeteries to a mine shaft opened near the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.

                        <p class="house_para">Constructed most likelyaround 1250 CE. by the O'Bannon clan that were the "secondary chieftains" of the territory and were subject to the 
                        ruling O'Carroll clan, eventually the O'Carrolls had gained possession.
                        Following the death of Mulrooney O'Carroll in 1532, family struggles plagued the O'Carroll clan. A fierce rivalry for the leadership erupted within the family. 
                        The bitter fight for power turned brother against brother. 
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete6">In 1659, the castle passed by marriage into the ownership of the Darby family. Séances were held in the castle by Mildred Darby who was a writer 
                        of Gothic novels: this led to publicity about the castle and its ghosts.
                        A Red Lady ghost is reported to walk the halls holding a dagger. Two little girls named Charlotte and Emily are reported to run up and down the spiral staircase. 
                        Emily died after she fell from the battlements on the top of the castle’s tower and Charlotte can still be seen running around after her sister and calling her name.
                        The castle is also allegedly haunted by a sinister elemental spirit referred to only as "It". The creature is described by Mildred Darby as being about the size of a 
                        sheep with a human face, black holes for eyes and a nose and giving off the smell of a rotting corpse.
                        During renovation of the castle in the 1900s, workers found an oubliette behind a wall in the chapel. At the bottom of the shaft were many human skeletons amassed on 
                        wooden spikes. When cleaned out, it took three cartloads to remove the bones. It is believed that the O’Carrolls would drop guests through the trap door to be impaled 
                        on the spikes 8 feet below.

                        <p class="house_para">Became famous in 1974 due to the facts occurring in it. Here the DeFeo family was murdered by the eldest son with a rifle, while his parents 
                        and four siblings were sleeping. In 1975 Lutz family bought the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect 
                        their decision, they decided that it was not a problem.
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete7">A friend of George Lutz learned about the history of the house and insisted on having it blessed, but the day the priest came, he left after 
                        hearing a voice telling him to “Get out!”
                        The Lutz family claimed to have seen slime coming out of the walls, knives being thrown off kitchen counters, and a red-eyed creature resembling a pig. 
                        They’ve seen figures wandering inside the home when it was supposed to be empty. George says he saw his wife levitating above their bed, and was woken up every 
                        morning at 3:15 a.m., the exact time that DeFeo killed his entire family. 
                        By mid-January 1976, after another attempt at a house blessing, they experienced what would turn out to be their final night in the house 28 days later of moving 
                        into the house. They had to leave the house due to the extrange events and paranormal phenomena while living there. The Lutzes declined to give a full account of 
                        the events that took place on this occasion, describing them as "too frightening".
                        The various owners of the house since the Lutz family left in 1976 have reported no problems while living there.

                        <p class="house_para">The story of this building goes back to the XVIII century. His owner Marie Delphine Lalaurie apparently had a double life, in public spaces 
                        she showed herself as very kind with people of black race and worrying about her slaves' health. She had an important position in New Orleans society that ended when 
                        in 1834 firefighters were called to extinguish a fire in the house. They discovered several slaves chained inside the house that were showing evidence of having been 
                        tortured for a long time.</p> 
                        <p id="complete8">On one occasion one of the neighbours saw one of the slaves, a 12 years old girl (Leah), die after falling off the roof’s mansion while she was 
                        running away to avoid being punished by lashing by Delphine. 
                        Leah was combing Delphine’s hair when she pulled the hair a bit too much by accident so that made Delphine to get angry and chase her with the whip. 
                        The body of the girl was buried in the front garden of the mansion.
                        This incident led to an investigation who found her guilty of illegal cruelty and they had to let go 9 slaves, but time after she managed to buy them back.
                        It has also been reported that Delphine had her cook chained to the kitchen’s oven and she used to beat her daughters when they were trying to feed the slaves.
                        After the fire incident, which led to the discovery of the situation, the LaLaurie house was looted by a multitude of angry citizens and it is believed that she escaped 
                        aris where it is thought she spent the rest of her life.
                        The house was in ruins until mid XVIII when it was restored and used decades after as school, music conservatory, delinquents refuge, bar, furniture store and 
                        luxury apartments.

                        <p class="house_para">The Island of the Dolls, originally owned by Don Julian Santana Barrera, is full of dolls hanging from trees and buildings covered with 
                        cobwebs and insects. The place was named during the 1950s when the owner began to hang them as protection against evil spirits. Julian was a neighbor of the Barrio 
                        de la Asunción, where he used to go to drink pulque after having sold his vegetables, until, due to superstitions, he began to preach the Bible, being expelled from 
                        the sector. 
                        </p> 
                        <p id="complete9">According to legend, a young girl drowned entangled among the lilies of the canal and her body was found on the banks of the Santampa chinampas. 
                        Don Julian began to experience inexplicable situations so terrified, placed dolls that he found in the garbage or in the canals of Cuemanco with the idea that they 
                        would scare the soul of the young girl who would cry out "I want my doll". He also found a doll floating nearby and, assuming it belonged to the deceased girl, hung it 
                        from a tree as a sign of respect. After this, he began to hear whispers, footsteps, in the darkness even though his hut hidden deep inside the woods of Xochimilco was 
                        miles away from civilization. 
                        Driven by fear, he spent the next fifty years hanging more and more dolls, some missing body parts, all over the island in an attempt to appease what he believed to be 
                        the drowned girl's spirit.
                        After Julian’s death in 2001, his body reportedly was found in the area where he found the girl’s body fifty years before the area became a popular tourist attraction 
                        where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as "charmed" not haunted even though travelers claim the dolls whisper to them.

                        <p class="house_para">Joelma building is one of the top haunted places to visit in Brazil.  Built in 1971, on 1 February 1974, an air conditioning unit on the twelfth 
                        floor overheated, starting a fire. There were 756 people in the building at the time. Because flammable materials had been used to furnish the interior, the entire 
                        building was engulfed in flames within 20 minutes.</p> 
                        <p id="complete10">Despite the best efforts of rescue personnel and witnesses, who shouted and created signs encouraging people to remain calm, 40 individuals jumped 
                        to escape the conditions inside and in failed attempts to grasp unreachable fire ladders. None of these jumpers survived.
                        The fire was extinguished at 1:30pm, with 179 deaths and 300 people injured. 
                        As of 2019, the Joelma fire remains the second-worst skyscraper fire ever in terms of the death toll, after the collapse of the twin World Trade Center towers in New York
                        City on September 11, 2001.
                        After the tragedy, it was rebuilt and renamed as Praca Da Bandeira. People here have reportedly claimed seeing ghosts roaming around the halls and rooms. 
                        It is also said that the mystery of 13 souls who were trapped in the elevator during the fire still haunts the place.

                        <p class="house_para">El Salto was a functional hotel from 1924 to 1990 located near the waterfalls of Tequendama. Since it is at the top of a hill, legend says that 
                        many people would book a night at the hotel and then throw themselves off the cliff to put an end to their lives. The fact that many people in the past chose that spot to 
                        commit suicide, made others believe that the hotel is haunted.</p> 
                        <p id="complete11">According to the local legend, the indigenous Muisca Indians used to jump from Tequendama Falls (to avoid capture by Spanish conquerors during the 
                        conquest of South America) and, where upon falling, they would transform into an eagle and fly to their freedom. This mythical story attracted the broken-hearted who 
                        leapt to their death from the hotel’s cliffs overlooking the falls.
                        The truth is, no one wants to stay there anymore because everyone is afraid of the haunting stories behind the creepy place so it was converted into a museum that 
                        would serve as a national symbol of cultural heritage and environmental restoration.

                        <p class="house_para">The building was originally built in 1867. It was once the home of one of the most prominent families in the city, The Masseys. As legend has it, in 1915, 
                        after the death of Massey’s beloved only daughter, Lillian, one of the maids was so stricken by grief that she hung herself. Another version of the story involves the maid killing 
                        herself for fears her rumoured affair with a Massey man would be revealed. </p> 
                        <p id="complete12">Either way, the ghostly image of a maid hanging by her neck has been seen by more than one Keg visitor over the years.
                        Ever since, the maid's spirit and other ghosts continue to haunt the mansion. Is presently used as a location for The Keg restaurant.
                        Melanie Elaraby was dining with her husband when she said she encountered two different spirits. As she was dining, she said she felt cold wisps on her arm that gave 
                        her goosebumps. She felt the light touches move onto her fingers and eventually the back of her neck. She also said she saw the flash of a young blonde woman standing b
                        ehind her.
                        Another testimony comes from another customer that was in the women's washroom alone at the Keg Mansion but insists she felt another presence with her the entire time. 
                        “I came out and looked at the stairs. A woman dressed in a dark, beautiful old fashion dress looked at me. I even said “Hi” to her when walking past and down the stairs. 
                        I felt weird about it, so I asked the host. He said there were only four male servers that night, no waitresses and definitely no one in an old fashion dress.”
